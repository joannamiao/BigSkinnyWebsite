<h2 style="text-align: center">Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <br/>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Durability </p>
    <div class="container">
<button class="accordion">Are Big Skinny products durable?</button>
<div class="panel"><p>
A:Yes, they last as long as regular leather wallets--our customers get 4-5 years of life from our nylon line. Our leather-nylon hybrid lines last 5+ years. Unlike regular wallets, Big Skinny wallets feature double-edged stitching which means the material is folded in, glued, and then stitched. This makes them sturdy enough to machine wash regularly-we've had customers launder them regularly if they routinely sweat or get them dirty. Unlike regular wallets, Big Skinny wallets have a 1-year materials and workmanship warranty whether you buy it on the website or at a retail outlet—just mail it back for a replacement</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How much thinner and lighter are they?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A:About 10 times thinner and lighter depending on the design and type of leather. That means once you start separating the wallet layers with your plastic and cash, our thin nylon material keeps your wallet at least 50% thinner than regular wallets that have thick leather layers. Most Big Skinny wallets weigh 1 ounce or less versus 3-6 ounces for most regular leather wallets. In fact, Big Skinny wallet material is as thin as a regular business card--.21 mm! When you start skinny, you stay skinny which is why all your stuff in a comprable Big Skinny wallet will result in at least a 50% to 75% difference than your regular stuffed wallet.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What are they made of?</button>
<div class="panel">
   <p>A:A new super-thin nylon micro-fiber material that is lined on the reverse with a non-slip coating to make it harder to lose your cards and cash. But don't worry, materials are synthetic so no rubber or other allergies have ever occurred. Most regular leather wallets have additional viscose or cloth lining which eventually makes cards and cash slip out as the leather wallet stretches over time. Our nylon weave is 230 dernier density which makes it pretty durable and tear resistant—you'd have to cut it with scissors or a knife to get through it. And our nylon-microfiber wallets are 100% Vegan.</p>
</div>
    <button class="accordion">Do they fit into pockets?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A:Yes, our designs will fit easily in a front or back pants or even shirt pockets. Even the Super Skinny will fit in men's pockets although it might be slightly too tall for women's pockets. Our special curve and taxicat series is designed to fit snugly into front pants pockets so they line up with the way your pocket is already cut so no sharp lines jabbing your legs.</p>

    </div><br/><br/>
    <p style="text-align: center">Maintenance</p>
    <div class="container">
<button class="accordion">Can I get my Big Skinny product wet?</button>
<div class="panel"><p>A: The material is water-resistant so it will just dry out in about ½ to 1 hour from an accidental laundering or a jump in the swimming pool. The non-slip interior also prevents moisture from coming through and soaking your goods. So go ahead and sweat or dance in the rain, our wallets keep your goods safe.
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Does the nylon material sweat?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A: No, unlike animal products such as leather, the Big Skinny is made from a petroleum-based material that doesn't sweat like leather does on a hot day. As a matter of fact, the non-slip interior keeps sweat from getting to your goodies. That also works with your leather hybrid Big Skinny because the interior also has the same lining.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What if I get it dirty—how do I clean it? </button>
<div class="panel">
   <p>A: Most customers just brush off any dirt or do a soapy hand-wash to clean their Big Skinny. Some just launder their nylon Big Skinnies—but we don't recommend putting it in a dryer!</p>
</div>
    <button class="accordion">Will the material stretch out? </button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A: It will stretch out a little over time but not to the degree that leather stretches out because leather is an animal-product while the Big Skinny is not. We've had customers give them a machine wash which tightens them a bit.</p>
</div>
    </div><br/><br/>
  <p style="text-align: center">Features</p>  
        <div class="container">
<button class="accordion">How many plastic cards do Big Skinnies hold? Can they hold as much as leather wallets? </button>
<div class="panel"><p>A: Often Big Skinnies hold even more than leather wallets because Big Skinny pockets are designed extra-wide. Each pocket can hold 5 plastic cards-trhy that with any ordinary leather wallet and see how quickly the seams tear. General speaking and depending on what else you have in your wallet-- this is how much some of our models usually hold: 
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sports Model and bifolds: Holds about 20-25 credit cards plus cash </li>
        <li>World Wallet,L-Shaped Trifolds can hold 25-30 credit cards plus cash </li>
<li>Trifolds: Hold about 20-25 credit cards plus cash </li>
<li>Super Skinny: Holds about 20-40 credit cards plus cash. </li>
<li>Passport Case: can also hold about 15-20 credit cards in the credit card slots </li>
<li>Card Cases & Holders can hold 8-30 plastic cards which is about 25-40 cardstock business cards. Each product page lists capacity and size.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can change fit?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A: Many of our models feature easy to access zippered compartments for change. For those models without zippered compartments, people often keep change in some of the pockets or billfold area-the non-slip interior helps keep a small amount of coins anchored nicely.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can passports fit? </button>
<div class="panel">
   <p>A: Yes depending on the model. Our passport holder, hipster, and travel wallets hold 2-4 U.S. passports plus credit cards and cash. Check the detailed measurements of all our models on the product pages and compare to your country's currency and passport measurements.</p>
</div>
    <button class="accordion">Can business cards fit? </button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A: Since Big Skinny pockets are created extra-wide, most regular business cards will fit easily into the pockets without dog-earing the corners. Assume each plastic card is equal to 2 business cards.</p>
</div>
            <button class="accordion"> I have pictures in a clear plastic insert; can I still use that with your wallets?</button>
            <div class="panel">
<p>A: Yes, just like in leather wallets, it works the same. Each of those booklets has a plastic tongue that fits into a pocket—sometimes this tongue is vertical, sometimes horizontal. Now we sell the inserts too. Just match it up with one of our wallets with multiple pockets and drop the tongue into the corresponding pocket and it works the same way as in leather wallets. Of course, we recommend you put those pictures in a cell-phone so your wallet can be thinner and plus you can carry even more pictures electronically.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">Location and Pricing</p>
    
     <div class="container">
<button class="accordion">Where else can I find Big Skinny wallets besides online?  </button>
<div class="panel"><p>A: We have a 30-day return as new policy so that eliminates a lot of the risk and allows you to try them out. Or check our website for the nearest specialty retail store or the nearest Fair or Festival that one of our trained vendor will have a Big Skinny pop-up shop.
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Why are some wallets more expensive than others?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A: We only use high-quality expensive top-grain leather (not cheap genuine leather) which is the only quality level of leather that can be sliced thin enough to make a thin wallet difference. Plus, this series features rounded corners and double-edged stitching for durability but which is also very labor intensive. It's just a higher-quality wallet all around which is why we are confident enough to offer a wallet warranty.</p>
